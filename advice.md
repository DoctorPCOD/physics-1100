# Advice from Previous Students

Every semester I ask students in this class to give advice to future students. Here is what they have to say!

**Note** if you're a summer student, note that the frequency of your assignments is much faster than what happens when I teach this class in the fall. So, if you're reading advice from a student who took the course in the fall, please take that into consideration!

AF, fall 2023:

> I would say make sure they have enough time to do their work.

AS, fall 2023:

> My advice would be to do your work when you have time don't leave it for the last minute.

CB, fall 2023:

> My advice for other students is that if life happens, the lecture videos on youtube are plenty to prepare for the tests. Algebra manipulation skills are also really helpful for the tests as well.

GA, fall 2023:

> If you can take in info fast and still comprehend it, I recommend speeding up the lectures, so you have more time for the homework. But don't push yourself if it is too fast to take in.

MF, fall 2023:

> I would say rewatch the lectures because they really help you understand.

AB, fall 2023:

> My biggest advice would be to get help on problems you can't grasp easily. Just by starting can help you w/ other struggles. This way you can get new strategies on grasping the info as well as some ideas to keep you motivated and organized.

LN, fall 2023:

> My advice would be to start the work early in the week, and pace every subject. Mix physics in throughout the week to stay motivated.

LK, fall 2023:

> Pay attention to schedule and the deadlines. Go to office hours to get a better understanding of a topic.

MP, fall 2023

> Go through every resource and look over the information 3 times before practicing the conceptual questions and it will help understand the physics lingo better.

DV, summer 2023:

> Advice I'd give is to make a schedule for yourself and stick to it even though this is an asynchronous class. Each task takes a decent amount of time, so it's better to work a little every day rather than leave all assignments for the same day they are due.

SM, summer 2023:

> My advice is to dedicate enough time to make yourself successful.

AM, summer 2023:

> The one thing I would advise students would be to leave enough time for this class and learn how to manage their time.

ID, summer 2023:

> My advice would be to definitely read the textbook, as it's a great combination with the lectures.

MK, summer 2023:

> My advice would be to do a little bit each day so the work load is not too overwhelming.

EM, summer 2023:

> My advice would be if you are struggling with a problem, just stop and take a break. Then the next day go back and it will likely make more sense by realizing the right equation to use, etc.

IB, summer 2023:

> Never skip a lecture. Start the assignments a week in advance. Make a lot of notes. Have a coffee machine nearby. Never give up. Take breaks if needed.

JH, summer 2023:

> Be consistent and break apart lessons over multiple days.

KH, summer 2023:

> My advice: break the work up into small sections and keep persevering. Categorize assignments by "brainpower needed" to be productive in whatever time I have.

MF, summer 2023:

> Focus on labs the most! These tie in a lot of different concepts and provide you with crucial real-world examples. Give yourself a full day (or more) to complete these.

PH, summer 2023:

> My advice would be to stay on top of the assignments

MZ, fall 2022:

> Some advice for other students taking this class would be to not give up on a confusing topic! You [Dr. Pasquale] have provided so many resources that it is nearly impossible to not understand a new concept. Also, use a calendar! It is amazing, and 100% commit to it!

MG, fall 2022:

> Advice I would give another student would be to plan work not just around your schedule, but what you can mentally handle.

JP, fall 2022:

> Let's not be disappointed even if we don't do well on the test. A score is just a number, but if you learn one thing, it will help you a lot.

AM, summer 2022:

> Be prepared to do a lot of math.

AL, summer 2022:

> I would recommend to stay on top of the material and clarify anything as you follow along.

AV, summer 2022:

> Use the weekend if you can would be my advice. If you do some work on the weekend it is less stressful later.

JG, summer 2022:

> Go over the material to see what you know and don't know.

AA, summer 2022:

> The advice I would give to other students is to take your time to comprehend the material and apply it to your own experiences. This has helped me apply the material and explain why certain things occur the way they do.

AB, summer 2022:

> Make sure to give yourself a lot of time before things are due b/c they can take a couple hours.

IH, summer 2022:

> Work ahead, do assignments a day in advance, don't put anything off, use the resources.

JB, summer 2022:

> The amount of coursework has been much more than other classes I've taken at COD. It has been challenging, I've been trying to get as much done as I can early and not leave anything to the last minute, if possible.

KB, summer 2022:

> My advice would be to also do your best to understand equations and the meanings of each variable.

RF, summer 2022:

> I would not wait to start the work, especially the labs take a very long time.

SJ, summer 2022:

> Don't get overwhelmed with all the new topics being thrown at you.

AS, fall 2021:

> My advice would be to simply put the work in, and even if you don't get everything right or understand things right away, do your very best.

RW, fall 2021:

> Be prepared for the time commitment. Try to get as much done as early in the week as possible.

TP, fall 2021:

> I would say take breaks in between activities to stay fresh when answering questions to avoid silly mistakes like 40/10 = 40.

EDF, fall 2021:

> An advice is to keep working on those labs and HW and to make time to watch the lectures since they help with explaining the content.

EK, fall 2021:

> I would say make sure you are able to manage the load of the work because it is a lot and don't procrastinate.

MB, fall 2021:

> Reread chapters when confused or unsure of something.

SC, fall 2021:

> I use an assignment notebook to keep up with the work. I start the lectures towards the beginning of the week, and work on the labs and homework throughout the week. I would suggest doing the same things so you don't get behind.
