# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## Where are the lectures?
The lectures have all been recorded already. You can find them on [Dr. Pasquale's YouTube playlist for this class](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo9WFV9pBhDtRfnN_PwI3G82QJaVj1XVu).

## What is the syllabus and where can I read it?
The syllabus is the document that outlines all official policies and procedures for this class. Please keep in mind that [the college has its own policies, outlined in the course catalog](https://catalog.cod.edu/academic-policies-procedures/). (Not all of the college policies are in the class syllabus, otherwise it would be way too long!)

I am extremely strict in abiding by my syllabus. Doing so allows me to be fair and equitable to all students. Please understand, if you ask me to break a syllabus policy as a favor to you, or "just this one time," my answer will be no. You are expected to abide by the policies outlined in the syllabus, whether or not you read it.

The syllabus is available on Blackboard.

## Where do I take the exams? Are they online?
**You will be required to take each exam in person.** You may take the exams at any one of COD's testing centers. [Their hours and locations are listed on this website.](https://www.cod.edu/academics/testing/hours.aspx) You will have a window of a few days to take exams. Each 3-hour exam must be taken in one sitting. (In other words, you cannot start the exam on Monday, and then come back on Tuesday to finish.) If you know that you will be unavailable during the windows of time provided for the exams in this class, consider enrolling in a different class section of physics 1100.

Students whose permanent address (as listed in MyAccess) is more than 50 miles from the COD main campus must contact Dr. P to create alternative arrangements for the exam. Information on this is in the next FAQ below.

## Can I take online exams?
Online exams are **not** a possibility for this class. There are many reasons for that borne of experience teaching during the pandemic. When you registered for this class, there was a notification that in-person exams would be required.

That said, if your permanent address is more than 50 miles from campus, alternative arrangements can be made so that you do not have to drive to COD to take your exams. This will require you to find a local community college or university with a testing center that will agree to proctor the three exams. There is paperwork that you can fill out to get COD the information they need to make arrangements with the local college or university to adminster your exams.

Just a note on your address: your permanent address is the address listed in MyAccess. If you reside more than 50 miles from campus, but your MyAccess address is in DuPage county, then you are not eligible for alternative test-taking arrangements and must come to COD's testing centers to take exams. There are no exceptions to this policy whatsoever.

If this testing arrangement does not work for you, please consider taking a different section of this class, or registering for a conceptual physics class at a college or university closer to where you currently reside.

## What will be on the exams?
Each exam has a multiple choice section and a short-answer section. The two midterms will only cover new topics. The final exam will be comprehensive in the multiple choice section, but will only ask new topics in the short answer section. The point value of each exam is given in the class syllabus. Other than that, I will not provide more detail about what exactly will be on the exams.

Each exam covers the chapters outlined below:
- Exam 1: Chapters 1-10
- Exam 2: Chapters 11-21
- Final exam: Chapters 1-34 (short answer questions chapters 22-34 only)

## Will you give us a study guide for the exams?
I will not provide a study guide for the exams. There is a lot of value in preparing your own study guide. During the process of doing so, you will review class content and identify the topics you feel strong with, and the topics you feel weak with and need extra work studying.

Please note that your guided notes are a great place to start when preparing your study guide!

[Here is a PDF of creating study guides from Utah State University that is a good outline to creating a study guide, if you're not sure how to get started.](docs/creating_study_guides.pdf)

## Do you have example problems I can work on to practice?
Unfortunately, at this time, I do not have any example problems you can work on. Keep in mind that your MyOpenMath homework assignments are currently the best place for you to get practice! You are also welcome to attend office hours or tutoring for extra help.

There are also example exercises at the end of each chapter in the class textbook. Use those for practice.

You are welcome to take a look at [Physics Classroom](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/) to see if they have any good example problems you can work out. I also like [HyperPhysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/index.html), although their website goes into a lot more detail than we do on a lot of topics.

## I forgot about an assignment! Can I retake it?
You can request up to three 24-hour extensions for labs and guided notes, but only if you ask at least 24 hours before the assignment is due (and prior to the conclusion of my weekly office hours). If it's past the assignment due date and time, then it's too late to ask for an extension. Late work is not accepted. MyOpenMath has three 24-hour late passes built in that you can use any time before the homework's initial due date and time.

All due dates are clearly labeled on MyOpenMath (homework) and Gradescope (labs and guided notes).

## Why did Gradescope submit my lab? I'm not done with it!
Any time you save your progress on a Gradescope assignment and exit the website, Gradescope submits your work. You can continue to work on the assignment and resubmit as many times as you'd like before the due date. A "submission" does not mean that the assignment cannot be changed. Once the due date hits, however, no more changes can be made to the assignment.

## How do I do _____ in Gradescope?
It's possible I've already made a how-to guide for what you're interested in. If not, send me an e-mail or ask on our Discord channel.

To sign up for Gradescope, you will get an e-mail from Gradescope itself on the very first day of class. Follow the instructions on the e-mail to create your account. You will not need an access code.

## Where can I get the Gradescope access code?
**There is no access code for our Gradescope class.** You will sign up using the e-mail that you will receive directly from Gradescope at 9:00 a.m. on our first day of class. If you don't receive the e-mail in a timely fashion, check your spam folder. If it's not there, contact Dr. Pasquale.

## I didn't have enough time to do the homework/lab/guided note. Can I get an extension?
You have three 24-hour extensions that you can use for labs or the guided notes. You must ask to use them 24 hours before the due date (and prior to the conclusion of my weekly office hours). If the due date has already passed, then it is too late to ask for an extension. Late work will not be accepted and will receive a score of zero. In MyOpenMath, you have three 24-hour Late Passes that you can use on assignments, as long as it's before the initial due date/time. Note that the last assignments in this class cannot be extended due to the need to have grades submitted by the end of the semester.

## How can I get the textbook?
[Our textbook is freely available online.](https://cod.pressbooks.pub/physics1100/)

## Do I really have to read every chapter in the textbook?
I mean, I can't tell you what to do. However, we will be covering every chapter in the textbook. You should be using the textbook as a resource to supplement the lectures and contribute to your learning. It's free, so there's no reason not to read it!

## Is it OK if I'm going to be on vacation for ___ days this semester?
You can absolutely do whatever you want with your time. However, with the exception of the few extensions you are allotted, there are no make-ups for any assignments. So if you plan on going on vacation without doing any schoolwork during that time, plan on the possibility of getting a poor grade in this class. If you already had big plans set to visit family or go on holiday, consider taking this class during a semester when you are able to devote time to it.

Be aware of the window of time that you will be expected to take each exam, as you will be required to take them in person. All other assignments can be completed remotely.

## Are there any extra credit assignments I can do?
Not, but there's extra credit built into exams. There are no "extra" extra credit activities. Your effort is best spent on doing your regular assignments, not on doing extra work.

If you're already doing the work, then you don't need extra credit. If you aren't already doing the work, then extra credit is not going to help you.

## I didn't get a good grade on _____, can I re-do it?
No. There are no make-ups allowed in this class.

If you didn't get a good grade on an assignment, that is a good opportunity to figure out what the reason may have been. Then, talk to Dr. P, or the peer tutor, and come up with a strategy for getting more caught up on whatever topic(s) may be troubling you.

## I'm in a different time zone. What time are my assignments due?
This class, being run from the College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn, IL, uses Central Time for all assignment deadlines. It is your responsibility to ensure that you turn things in by the correct deadline, regardless of the time zone that you are currently in.

## I can't see the videos on Pivot. What should I do?
I highly recommend using the Firefox browser when using Pivot. If that doesn't help, contact Pivot support using the chat box in the lower-right corner of the screen (see screen shot below).

I know it's not always possible, but try to start working on labs as soon as you can at the start of the week so that issues like this can be worked out before the assignment is due.

![Screen shot of Pivot showing the chat box in the lower right corner of the screen](https://github.com/DoctorPCOD/physics-1100/blob/main/img/pivot_help.png)

## Why haven't you responded to my e-mail?
This class is asychronous, but my office hours are synchronous. That means I have regular office hours that take place every week. If I recieve your e-mail during my office hours, I will respond right away. Otherwise, I will not necessarily read your e-mail until my next scheduled office hour session. Please be patient and keep that in mind before sending me a follow-up e-mail.

Because the hours that I can provide quick access to help are limited, please plan ahead when doing assignments. (For example: If you e-mail me at 11:00 p.m., one hour before an assignment is due, I will not respond before the assignment deadline.)

## What if I urgently need help solving a homework or lab?
If you urgently need help solving a question in an assignment, and it's during my office hours, I am available over e-mail or in person _when my office hours are on campus_. I'm available on Zoom only by appointment. Tutoring services may also be available, but they are usually by appointment. My suggestion is always going to be to start assignments early so you're not struggling at the last minute. If you urgently need help and it's outside of my office hours, there is not much that I can do to assist at that point.
